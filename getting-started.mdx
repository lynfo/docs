# Lynfo

> Lynfo, because editing `.swift-format` by hand was just too easy.

A macOS app that formats your Swift code and enforces style. Basically the thing you could do yourself, but we wrapped it in a shiny app so you don‚Äôt have to pretend you enjoy config files.

## ‚ùì FAQs

**Should I read the rest of these FAQs?**  
Absolutely not. Go do something productive instead, feed your pet, run a marathon, or finally figure out how your dishwasher works.

---

**What are the system requirements?**  
You‚Äôll need **macOS 15.0 or later**. Will it work perfectly? No promises. We only focus on the latest versions, so if you are still clinging to an old OS, consider this your gentle push to finally upgrade.

---

**Is the app free of bugs?**  
Of course not. This is a beta, bugs are basically a feature. Consider it our way of keeping you on your toes.

---

**Is the app free?**  
For now, yes, while it‚Äôs in beta. In the future? Who knows. Maybe it will stay free, maybe it will cost as much as a small island. Keep guessing, we like the suspense.

---

**Should I use Lynfo?**  
Honestly? You could. But you can also just edit the `.swift-format` file directly, it‚Äôs ridiculously easy. The more we explain it, the more it feels like using this app makes absolutely no sense.

---

**Why was Lynfo built?**  
Because I built an extension that got 780 stars (yes, humble brag, people actually used it). But now that Xcode supports Swift Format natively, that extension is about as useful as a floppy disk. So now we‚Äôre focusing on the app instead.

---

**Why does the build expire?**  
Because everything in life expires: milk, free trials, your motivation on Mondays. Just upgrade the app and stop asking philosophical questions.

---

**Why does the app ask to start at login?**  
Because it‚Äôs an Xcode companion, quietly stalking your `.swift-format` file to reflect changes instantly. It just works better that way. You really should enable it, seriously, you should. But it‚Äôs not mandatory, live dangerously if you want.

---

**I found a bug, what should I do?**  
You can send it to [app@lynfo.app](mailto:app@lynfo.app). We do not promise to fix it, but we might take a look. Or not. Depends on how entertaining the bug is.

---

**Will Lynfo make me a better developer?**  
Absolutely not. That still requires coffee, sleep, and reading the documentation you keep ignoring. Lynfo just makes your `.swift-format` life a little less painful.

---

**Can I suggest a FAQ?**  
Sure, why not. Send your groundbreaking idea to [app@lynfo.app](mailto:app@lynfo.app). Just don‚Äôt expect us to reply faster than your grandma typing with one finger.
